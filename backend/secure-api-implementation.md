# Secure API Implementation

## Overview
Design and implement a secure API for a financial application that handles sensitive user data and transactions while protecting against common security vulnerabilities.

## Requirements

### Core Features
1. Create a Node.js backend with:
   - User authentication and authorization system
   - Secure password management
   - Role-based access control
   - API endpoints for account management and transactions
   - Audit logging for security events

2. Implement the following security measures:
   - Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
   - API rate limiting
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Secure session management
   - HTTPS configuration

### Database Requirements
1. Use Prisma with a database of your choice (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to implement:
   - Secure storage of user credentials
   - Transaction records with proper integrity controls
   - Sensitive data encryption
   - Database access controls

### Technical Challenges
1. **Authentication**: Implement a secure JWT-based authentication system
2. **Authorization**: Create a flexible permission system
3. **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
4. **API Security**: Protect against common API attacks (injection, CSRF, etc.)

## Advanced Features (Optional)
1. Implement two-factor authentication
2. Add API key management for third-party integrations
3. Create a comprehensive security logging and monitoring system
4. Implement API versioning with backward compatibility

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Security Implementation**: Effectiveness of security measures
2. **Code Organization**: Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
3. **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
4. **Testing**: Security-focused tests and vulnerability scanning
5. **Documentation**: Clear API documentation and security considerations

## What We Value

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Secure by Default**: Conservative default settings that prioritize security
3. **Clean, Maintainable Code**: Well-structured code that's easy to audit
4. **Proactive Security**: Consideration of potential threats beyond the obvious
5. **Balanced Approach**: Security measures that don't unnecessarily impact usability

## Submission Guidelines

1. Use this repo as a template
2. Invite StAmirey as collaborator
3. Complete source code for your solution
4. A README file that includes:
   - Setup instructions for running your solution locally
   - Overview of your approach and architecture
   - Any assumptions or limitations of your implementation
   - Explanation of key design decisions
   - What you would improve with more time
