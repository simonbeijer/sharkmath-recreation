# Technical Assessment Guidelines

## About Us and Our Technology Stack

At Caput Venti, we build modern, scalable web applications that prioritize user experience, performance, and security. Our technology stack includes:

**Backend:**
- Node.js ecosystem for server-side development
- Microservices
- Prisma ORM for database interaction
- Various database technologies depending on the use case (MySQL being our primary choice)
- gRPC for efficient service-to-service communication
- RESTful and GraphQL APIs

**Frontend:**
- Modern JavaScript frameworks (SolidJS and React)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- State management libraries appropriate to the framework

We value clean, maintainable code that follows best practices and strikes a balance between performance, readability, and developer experience.

## Task Selection

We've provided several technical assessment tasks across different domains including backend, frontend, fullstack, algorithms, and system design. Please select **one task** that best aligns with your skills and interests to complete. While focusing on a single task is recommended, you're welcome to complete multiple tasks if you'd like to showcase a broader range of abilities.

## Time Expectations

Each task is designed to take approximately 3-5 hours to complete. We respect your time and don't expect you to spend more than this, though you're free to expand on the solution if you're enjoying the challenge.

## Use of AI Tools

We recognize that AI tools are increasingly part of modern development workflows. **You are allowed and encouraged to use AI assistants** (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help with your solution. However, please note:

1. You should understand all code in your submission thoroughly
2. During follow-up discussion, you'll need to explain your design decisions and implementation details
3. We'll evaluate your understanding of the solution rather than whether you created it entirely without assistance

## What We Value

Regardless of which task you choose, we value:

1. **Clean, non-nested code** that's easy to read and maintain
2. **Robustness** in handling edge cases and unexpected inputs
3. **Clarity** in both code structure and documentation
4. **Testability** and test coverage for critical functionality
5. **Performance** considerations and optimizations
6. **Security** best practices appropriate to the task

## Submission Process

Please submit your solution as a GitHub repository with:

1. Use this repo as a template
2. Invite StAmirey as collaborator
3. Complete source code for your solution
4. A README file that includes:
   - Setup instructions for running your solution locally
   - Overview of your approach and architecture
   - Any assumptions or limitations of your implementation
   - Explanation of key design decisions
   - What you would improve with more time

## Evaluation

Your submission will be evaluated on:

1. Meeting the core requirements of the selected task
2. Code quality and organization
3. Architectural decisions and their rationale
4. Problem-solving approach
5. Your ability to explain and discuss your solution

Remember that we're more interested in your thought process and approach than in a perfect, feature-complete solution. Be prepared to discuss trade-offs you made and alternative approaches you considered.
