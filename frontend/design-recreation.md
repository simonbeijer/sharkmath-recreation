# Design Recreation from Figma

## Overview
Recreate one of the designs from the provided Figma file using either React or SolidJS with TailwindCSS. This task evaluates your ability to translate visual designs into clean, maintainable, and performant code.

## Requirements

### Core Features
1. Choose and implement one complete design from the Figma file:
   - Achieve pixel-perfect visual fidelity to the design
   - Implement all interactive elements shown in the design
   - Ensure responsive behavior across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

2. Build a scalable codebase that demonstrates:
   - Component reusability and modularity
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy extensibility for future development
   - Proper state management where applicable

### Technical Requirements
1. **Framework**: Use either React or SolidJS
2. **Styling**: Implement using TailwindCSS exclusively
3. **Performance**: Optimize for fast initial load and smooth interactions
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support
5. **Browser Support**: Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Focus Areas (Choose at least one)
You may choose to emphasize one or more of these areas:
1. **Animations**: Implement smooth, performant animations and micro-interactions
2. **Responsive Scaling**: Advanced responsive design with fluid typography and spacing
3. **SEO Optimization**: Server-side rendering or static generation for optimal SEO
4. **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and bundle optimization

## Advanced Features (Optional)
1. Implement advanced interaction patterns (if present in design)
2. Add loading states and skeleton screens
3. Create a component library/design system
4. Implement dark mode support
5. Add PWA capabilities

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Design Fidelity**: How accurately the implementation matches the Figma design
2. **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and well-structured code
3. **Component Architecture**: Reusable and maintainable component structure
4. **Performance**: Page load speed and runtime performance
5. **Responsive Implementation**: Quality of mobile and tablet experiences
6. **Chosen Focus Area**: Excellence in your selected specialization

## What We Value

1. **Production-Ready Code**: Code that could be deployed and maintained in a real project
2. **Attention to Detail**: Pixel-perfect implementation and polished interactions
3. **Smart Abstractions**: Creating reusable components without over-engineering
4. **Performance Consciousness**: Understanding and implementing web performance best practices
5. **Clear Documentation**: Well-commented code and clear README instructions

## Important Notes

- You don't need to complete every element if time is limited - focus on quality over quantity
- The code should be structured as if you or another developer would continue building additional pages
- Demonstrate your strengths through your chosen focus area

## Submission Guidelines

1. Use this repo as a template
2. Invite StAmirey as collaborator
3. Complete source code for your solution
4. A README file that includes:
   - Which design you chose and why
   - Setup instructions for running your solution locally
   - Your chosen focus area(s) and implementation details
   - Architecture decisions and component structure
   - Performance optimizations implemented
   - What you would add or improve with more time
