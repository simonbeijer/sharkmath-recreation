# Creative Project: Task Management Application

## Overview
Build a modern task management application from scratch without a provided design. This task evaluates your ability to create intuitive user interfaces, make design decisions, and implement a cohesive user experience using React or SolidJS with TailwindCSS.

## Requirements

### Core Features
1. Create a task management system that includes:
   - Task creation with title, description, and due date
   - Task categorization using tags or projects
   - Multiple task views (list, board/kanban, calendar)
   - Task status management (todo, in-progress, completed)
   - Search and filter functionality
   - Task priority levels

2. Design and implement the interface demonstrating:
   - Consistent visual language and design system
   - Intuitive navigation and information architecture
   - Thoughtful use of color, typography, and spacing
   - Mobile-first responsive design

### Technical Requirements
1. **Framework**: Use either React or SolidJS
2. **Styling**: Implement using TailwindCSS exclusively
3. **State Management**: Implement proper state management for tasks
4. **Data Persistence**: Use localStorage or IndexedDB for data persistence
5. **Routing**: Implement client-side routing for different views

### Creative Freedom Areas
You have complete creative control over:
1. **Visual Design**: Color schemes, typography, layout patterns
2. **Interaction Patterns**: How users create, edit, and manage tasks
3. **Feature Prioritization**: Which additional features to include
4. **Information Hierarchy**: How to organize and display task information

### Focus Areas (Choose at least one)
1. **Innovative UI/UX**: Create unique interaction patterns or visualizations
2. **Advanced Animations**: Implement delightful micro-interactions and transitions
3. **Productivity Features**: Add features like keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions, or smart sorting
4. **Performance & Scaling**: Optimize for handling thousands of tasks efficiently

## Advanced Features (Optional)
1. Implement drag-and-drop functionality
2. Add data visualization for task analytics
3. Create a dashboard with productivity insights
4. Implement collaborative features (mock multi-user)
5. Add notification system for due dates
6. Create custom themes or color schemes

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Design Quality**: Visual appeal and consistency of the created design
2. **User Experience**: Intuitiveness and ease of use
3. **Code Architecture**: Clean, scalable, and maintainable code structure
4. **Feature Implementation**: Quality and polish of implemented features
5. **Creative Problem Solving**: Innovative solutions to UX challenges
6. **Responsive Design**: Quality of mobile and tablet experiences

## What We Value

1. **Design Thinking**: Thoughtful UI/UX decisions that prioritize user needs
2. **Consistency**: Cohesive design language throughout the application
3. **Innovation**: Creative solutions that go beyond typical implementations
4. **Code Quality**: Well-structured, reusable components
5. **Attention to Detail**: Polished interactions and edge case handling

## Design Constraints

While you have creative freedom, ensure your design:
- Is professional and suitable for a productivity tool
- Follows accessibility best practices
- Uses a consistent spacing and sizing system
- Implements a clear visual hierarchy

## Important Notes

- You don't need to complete every element if time is limited - focus on quality over quantity
- The code should be structured as if you or another developer would continue building additional pages
- Demonstrate your strengths through your chosen focus area

## Submission Guidelines

1. Use this repo as a template
2. Invite StAmirey as collaborator
3. Complete source code for your solution
4. A README file that includes:
   - Overview of your design decisions and rationale
   - Setup instructions for running your solution locally
   - Explanation of your chosen focus area(s)
   - Key features and how to use them
   - Technical architecture overview
   - Design system documentation (colors, spacing, components)
   - What you would add or improve with more time
