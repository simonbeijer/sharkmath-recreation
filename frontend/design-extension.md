# Design Extension: Next Page Creation

## Overview
Choose one design from the provided Figma file, implement it, and then create the logical "next page" or related pages that would follow in the user journey. This task evaluates your ability to understand design systems, maintain consistency, and extend existing designs creatively.

## Requirements

### Part 1: Initial Implementation
1. Select and implement one design from the Figma file:
   - Achieve high fidelity to the original design
   - Extract and document the design system (colors, typography, spacing)
   - Build reusable components based on the design patterns
   - Ensure responsive implementation

### Part 2: Design Extension
1. Create the logical next page(s) in the user journey:
   - Identify what page(s) would naturally follow your chosen design
   - Maintain the exact visual style and design language
   - Create new components that fit seamlessly with existing ones
   - Implement smooth transitions between pages

2. Extension examples based on common designs:
   - Landing page → Feature details, pricing, or sign-up flow
   - Dashboard → Detail views, settings, or data entry forms
   - Product listing → Product details, cart, or checkout
   - Profile page → Edit profile, settings, or activity feed

### Technical Requirements
1. **Framework**: Use either React or SolidJS
2. **Styling**: Implement using TailwindCSS exclusively
3. **Design Consistency**: Maintain pixel-perfect consistency with original design language
4. **Navigation**: Implement routing between original and extended pages
5. **State Management**: Share state appropriately between pages

### Focus Areas (Choose at least one)
1. **User Journey**: Create a compelling and logical flow between pages
2. **Component System**: Build a robust, reusable component library
3. **Interaction Design**: Add meaningful transitions and micro-interactions
4. **Advanced Features**: Implement complex interactions that enhance the experience

## Advanced Features (Optional)
1. Create multiple extended pages showing different user paths
2. Implement advanced page transitions and animations
3. Add interactive prototyping features
4. Create a living style guide documenting your extensions
5. Implement state persistence across page navigation

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Design Understanding**: How well you grasp and extend the original design language
2. **Consistency**: Maintaining visual and interaction consistency
3. **User Experience**: Creating logical and intuitive page flows
4. **Creative Extension**: Quality and creativity of your design additions
5. **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable implementation
6. **Component Reusability**: Effective component architecture

## What We Value

1. **Design System Thinking**: Understanding and extending design patterns systematically
2. **User-Centered Design**: Creating pages that serve real user needs
3. **Attention to Consistency**: Seamless integration with original design
4. **Creative Problem Solving**: Thoughtful solutions for new page requirements
5. **Production Quality**: Code that's ready for real-world use

## Important Guidelines

- Your extended pages should feel like they were designed by the same designer
- Focus on understanding the implicit design rules and patterns
- Consider the business context and user goals when creating new pages
- Document your design decisions and rationale

## Important Notes

- You don't need to complete every element if time is limited - focus on quality over quantity
- The code should be structured as if you or another developer would continue building additional pages
- Demonstrate your strengths through your chosen focus area

## Submission Guidelines

1. Use this repo as a template
2. Invite StAmirey as collaborator
3. Complete source code for your solution
4. A README file that includes:
   - Which design you chose and your rationale
   - Analysis of the original design system
   - Explanation of your page extension choices
   - User journey documentation
   - Component library overview
   - Design decisions for extended pages
   - Setup instructions for running your solution
   - What additional pages or features you would add with more time
